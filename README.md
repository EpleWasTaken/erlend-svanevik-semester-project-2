# Semester Project 2 / Bergen Shoe Shop

![image](./src/img/)

A simple overview of the project. I am fetching cat facts from the API and displaying them on the front page, you can click a individual fact and you get brought to the details page for that specific fact.

## Description

This is the javascript frameworks course assignment, which had nothing to do with styling. It's simply for showing what I've learned during the course which was more technical oriented. I will visit it at a later date to add some styling to it.

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Wordpress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
- [Cat fact API](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts)
